I am a social worker at a private art college, and I love my work! When I'm not working I'm rock climbing, helping animals, exploring the city. At home I spend my time drawing and making things, reading, watching films, or playing with my cats.

I've been studying spanish for 4 years now, and have a small crush on Latin America:). I travel at least 2 times a year b/c I think it's important to remind myself that there is a world outside of my own, and I enjoy meeting new people and learning about other cultures. 

I feel lucky to be living in NYC, and do my best to take advantage of the arts, the culture, and anything that might be free:). 

I'm mostly a quiet person, but I'm also friendly and good-humored. I like to meet new people, I'm helpful, but I also give people their space.",0.465273969836,0.475882248388,1.043179598,0.661445272075,a

My work enables me to work with leaders and teams in high tech organizations to focus on the talents of the individuals and create an environment where they can be at their best most of the time.

— Bernard M. Baruch

I enjoy traveling, meeting people from diverse cultures, baking, trying different cuisines, socializing, concerts, watching travel shows and dancing.  I enjoy walking to nearby Fort Greene Park or all the way to Lower Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge, and attending free concerts/festivals in NYC's beautiful parks during the summer. 

I have a keen interest in what's going on in the rest of the world. I am involved in cultural exchange meetup groups, which gives me the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. One group, a language exchange meetup allows me to practice my Spanish whilst helping non-native English speakers to practice and improve their English. 

I love shopping and am a bargain shopper at heart. I always like to make sure that visitors to NYC get the best deals for their money. Moreover, as someone who travels solo often, I know how important it is for women to be in a clean, comfortable, and safe environment. 

PLEASE NOTE - VERY IMPORTANT
Kindly send me a message before trying to book. I will respond to you as soon as possible and let you know, if the room is available. You'll get a clean, tidy, safe and comfortable place to stay in, and a kind and helpful host; I'd like a guest who is responsible, respectful, pleasant, drama free and willing to clean up after herself.

417523,"Let me tell you a bit about myself. 

Born in England. Raised in San Diego, CA. Found myself in Tibet. Got lost in University. Found my first self in Melbourne. Became a Web Developer in Chicago.

I'm a California transplant in Austin. Now I work as a software engineer for an established startup here in town. 

I don't smoke. I don't have any pets, but love cats and dogs. I continue to struggle to be an early bird, but like to burn the candle at both ends. In my free time, I try to live a healthy lifestyle, staying active in all that there is to do in Austin. I'm a big fan of events and socializing. Yet, when I'm at home I prefer less chaos more peace. 

After a day of sitting in front of a computer I prefer to spend time chatting with my friends. I keep a clean house, let's hope you do too. I enjoy cooking and friends. Yet, I'm always am respectful of working or sleeping hours.

In my free time I like to explore. I'll find local volunteering opportunities, having worked keeping Beer Festivals green and Film Projectors spinning. I enjoy the cool halls of a museum, as long as you don't mind me poking fun at Modern Art. I'll share a classy cocktail or craft beer, but I'm a coffee fan first and foremost.

I've got a big thing for getting outside, and though my job keeps me ball-and-chained to my computer, I'd run, jump, hike, swim and skateboard to enjoy my nights and weekends.

I'm clean and courteous, I like to cook and happy to help around my community. I know I'm a new airbnb, but I always do my best to make a great first impression.

PHILOSOPHY

Challenge myself.

Live for my dreams.

You can do it if you think you can.

We are new to AirBnB but we’re not new to the rental business.  In fact, we’ve been doing it longer than AirBnB.  If you ever rented a private RV in San Diego you probably rented it from us, or at least ran across our business.  In fact, if you go to YouTube and search for “ComeGetMyRV Fox 5 News” you can see the news segment as well as other customer testimonials about the quality of rental service we’ve been providing since 2006.  But before you ask, and start planning an RV road trip to San Diego we sold the RV business, moved to WA, used our prior experience from that business and now have rental properties in Seattle and Sammamish. 

The Sammamish lake view property is located on the ""East Side,"" an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the Seattle property is on the ""West Side"" in a suburb next to downtown Seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.  While that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some, it was a long way of telling you that even though we don’t have a lot of reviews on AirBnB, we are trustworthy, experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that you’ll have the best stay possible.

4581592,"I'll try nearly anything once; I am a 46 y/o adventurous spirit. I've gone bungee jumping, bridge walking, and rock climbing. I enjoy swimming, tennis, basketball and jiu jitsu.

I bring warmth to those around me and extend myself when others need a hand. I believe attracting positive things to my life is a result of sharing my positive energy with others.

I've been dedicated to my career in public health - psychology. My early affinity for helping others, as my mom says, developed when I was very young.  The large family that I hail from weren't much help in deterring me away from a career in helping others either.

Since eligible to work at the age of 16, I've held some type of job in public health that I fostered into a career with the help of a BA, then MA in Psychology.  My more recent venture is a return to school for a Ph.D. Between work, school, volunteering and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life, I have a rich schedule that keeps me on my toes.

I've done a bit of traveling in my life. At an early age, family vacations took me to Canada and Mexico and in more recent years personal and business brought me to Paris, Malaysia, Holland, Singapore, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany, Peru, Hungary, Japan and Italy. Domestically, I've been to all of the West Coast States, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Utah, New York, and Florida to spout off a few. :-)

I look forward to meeting many folks through this service, perhaps one of those people will be you.

I know I am helping to people and *giving them a deal*, so remember that if you appreciate my hospitality you can always come back.

I am a very caring and considerate host; also I am a very busy person and my life does not shape around Airbnb and I do this as a hobby.

15018669,"If it's not obvious, I'm a designer - an ex-architect who after twenty years sold my eight-person branding and graphic design studio here in NO in order to go out on my own and re-focus my work. In May of 2014 I was lucky enough to be able to buy the guest house across the street from mine from my wonderful neighbors, do a little renovation, and share it with the world. I work from home most of the time (unless I'm at The Orange Couch, my favorite coffee shop not far away) so I'm often around. 

I'm generally a vegetarian, but lately I've fallen off the wagon for seafood - we'll see about that. I love riding my bike in the Quarter. My teenage son is 6'4"" and counting (and that doesn't come from me). I'm pretty handy with tools and gadgets. I'm kind of a closet sci-fi fan. My favorite thing about this city is where the old meets the new. I have a background in classical music, having played the 'cello in my youth (fell off that wagon too, sadly), but some day want to play new music. I love the IDEA of books, but read too slowly to make it happen much. I love traveling, but these days I don't get to enough (I'm looking forward to living a little vicariously through you). I love dashes (and parenthetical comments). It will seem odd once you meet me, but I grew up in Dallas, Texas (and I still miss good Tex-Mex). 

I came here to Tulane in 1984, during the World's Fair - and I never left (except for an almost year-long stint in Austin after Katrina). In contrast to all the other eighteen-year-olds in my midst, I didn't really like New Orleans at first - I felt like the place was dirty, nothing worked, the people weren't so bright. Then, at some magic moment I GOT it - the place is not dirty - it's well-worn with a patina that reflects that it is REAL and loved and storied. Everything works that we NEED to have working, and we don't fret too much about the rest. And as for the people - well, in fact, they understand things that apparently no one any place else seems to understand. They have their priorities straight, and then some. My college friends are still flummoxed - and super-jealous.

When my son and I moved to Bywater from Uptown in 2007, I was probably a little conspicuously polished for the neighborhood, but as the area has gotten fancier since then, I no longer stand out so much. I love the neighborhood as it is today - it's pretty hard to argue with the quality of life. But certainly it is a little less ""romantic"" (depending, I guess, on what you romanticize - I do like some patina and weirdness and the tall bikes that are not as common as they were) than when I first got here. In Rebecca Solnit's amazing recent book ""Unfathomable City"" (you can find a copy in the house), one of the maps featured shows insights as to where different kinds of people live in NO - my neighborhood is full of folks who ""gentrify and question gentrification"". I guess that's me. I love it, but I do miss some of the rough edges.

Anyway, all this to say - I love Bywater like my own. It IS my own. And I look forward to you becoming part of it in your own way too. Walk it, bike it, eat it, drink it. And let me know how I can help you do all that!",0.351151011672,0.201113321934,0.472496199292,0.341586844299,a

Realizing the ocean is way cooler than the desert we moved to the coast and have been enjoying sunny California for over three years in the most amazing townhouse right by the water.  Together, we've traveled to Australia, Bali, New Zealand, Fiji, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, Costa Rica, Mexico and Nepal.   Pretty much every country is on our travel wish list.  When we travel we enjoy really staying at unique places that allow you to immerse yourself in the community. In turn, we love showing our now home of Venice Beach to any and all people unfamiliar.   
 We both work in hospitality at local restaurants. I am a bartender and David is a server.  One last bonus, David is an artist by passion and you will find his color adorning our walls as well as the probability of getting the opportunity of watching a painting in the making. 
 You should also know there is Loki. He is our 9 pound Yorki that loves attention and guests. He is hypo-allergenic and a great character to boot. He is our official ""welcoming committee"" and we have yet to meet someone that didn't like him. 
 We both are active in the community and have great advice on where to go and what to do in Venice and surrounding areas.

1)  I have an amazing partner, Meredith, and an ever fluctuating number of kids living with us.

2)  The reason why the number of kids changes is because we are foster parents.  

3)  Being a foster mom is the hardest and most rewarding thing I have ever done.

4)  I began hosting on airbnb as a way to supplement our income and allow me to stay home with our kiddos.

5)  I'm so glad I did, because I LOVE being an airbnb host!

6)  When I have some free time, I love to garden or putter around outside doing projects.

7)  I love animals but never expected to have quite so many.

8)  I also never expected to be washing so much laundry as an adult. :)

9)  I make really good English Toffee.

10)  I always share some of my toffee with guests.  :)",0.20363672904,0.874832435412,0.770465053744,0.616311406065,a

I love being surrounded by such a diverse population of people who serve as an infinite font of energy and inspiration. I fancy myself a creative intellectual and love nothing more than sharing an amazing meal with close friend or perhaps traveling a foreign country, sampling the best of what that unique locale has to offer. As far as traveling goes, I've had the privilege of seeing much of Western and Northern Europe (and even living in Madrid for almost a year and Copenhagen for a summer) as well as visiting Morocco, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Mexico to name a few. Food is a huge love of mine, and I am a pescetarian (anything to stem our ridiculous love affair with destroying the environment), although I don't cook at home. Years ago one of my good friends coined the term ""maximist"" to describe my uncanny affinity for experiencing or owning the best of what's available.

I'm an all around entrepreneur. For years I sold gaming and collectibles in my own stores, on several websites, and on Ebay and Amazon.  I've also been a Lyft driver and mentor for the last year or so, driving around town sharing stories and meeting new people.  I'm also a dad, so you may run into two adorable tiny humans during your stay.  I love BBQ and whiskey and checking out new bars and restaurants.  Also living here is my friend Kathy.  She's also a Lyft driver and is currently finishing up nursing school.  She likes to play guitar and bake chocolate chip cookies (but not at the same time).  I have two friendly laboradors (Bailey and Baxter) and Kathy has a timid cat (Elphie).

We are typically up early for work, as are the dogs. We certainly try to keep noise to a minimum but light sleepers should be warned. My children also visit every Wednesday during the day (after 9am). They're little so we're still working on being quiet when people are sleeping. If you know you need a late sleep let us know and we can come back to the house a little later in the morning. 

I hope you'll enjoy your stay in my awesome Buena Park apartment! The neighborhood is great with just about anything you need close by. If you need help with anything during your stay please do not hesitate to ask.

I have always been interested in showing hospitality to others.  Before airbnb this was mostly done by inviting friends and others over to my home for dinner or cocktails....but I find it equally rewarding to be able to host a traveler and know that my home with influence their trip for the better.  

As I am getting older I have decided that I really want to travel and see more of the world...but limited finances (coupled with my refusal to sit int he back of planes) as well as a desire to really get to see how people live and just not how tourists are treated makes this a great option for me!  

I have quite a few different interests, but I am very into anything design related (architecture, shops, urban life) and am an avid collector of mid century furnishings and love modern art from around 1910 to 1960.  I am happy to have one black cat (I like cat's but one is just enough to keep it interesting) and love to entertain friends often.  I am also a sucker for British TV, and you will often find BBC America in the background.

I was lucky enough to have the New York Times recently devote two entire pages to me in their home section, making me sound much more interesting in print as compared with in reality and publishing some lovely pictures of my life.

5772713," A little about me: I'm a 33 year old woman currently residing in Portland, Oregon. I have a true passion for all things vintage. I work for myself full time dealing vintage. I especially love refinishing old furniture (my therapy), big funky jewelry from the 1960's/1970's (I have a getting-out-of-control personal collection of it), vintage pieces of original artwork (one of my flea market friends is convinced he sold me an original Worhal), any type of woven, colorful basket. (my current obsession), and anything Art Deco. I spend most days ""treasure hunting"" and sell my finds online, in a shop in Portland called Monticello,  and at local antique/vintage shows. One day soon- I hope to have a little vintage shop to call my own. In July 2014, a longterm tiny home owning dream of mine came to fruition when I purchased my current property, which came with a tiny cottage in the yard. I rent that out to longer stay travelers (30 days+), and when it has a few days open in between travelers, I invite my friends and family to come and stay in it. At this moment in time, my main focus is growing my businesses-Experimental Vintage,  and putting love into my almost 100 year old tiny house. I feel truly lucky to be able to do the things I love to earn a living! In my free time I enjoy meditation, photography, cooking and eating good food, drinking good wine, exercising, practicing yoga, and listening to live music. I have done some traveling- including a semester in Australia during my undergrad, a summer backpacking around Europe, as well as leisurely travel to parts of Indonesia and Costa Rica. I am hoping that a month in Thailand will be my next big adventure. I like to explore various hobbies and have dabbled in darkroom photography, jewelry smithing, furniture reupholstering, and other creative ventures.

5575395,"I'm 33 years old and live in a cozy basement apartment in Woodside, Queens, NYC. I work full time in the Architecture/Construction Management field. I love travelling and seeing new places, but I opt for a more ""raw"", local experience when I travel rather than the typical touristy, luxurious experience. I feel that I get more from my trips that way! I like my life in the ""concrete jungle"", but I always find myself looking forward to holidays or long weekends to plan a vacation with the purpose to get out and enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. I found out about AirBnb through a co-worker last year when my bf and I planned our trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico and it worked great for us! We liked where we stayed and our hosts were very friendly and attentive.After that great experience I understood how this works, and decided to host guests in my apartment as well... with the intention to share knowledge, and learn from other cultures.My motto is to live my life to the fullest because I'll never know when it's gone.

Welcome in my hotel ""Lapa"" Let me show you around.I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago from Brazil and  a very good friend Jonathan from Chicago .

You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family.  I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil and Tunisia. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.My rooms are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the apartments. All rooms great available with new furniture, AC, WiFi and Cable. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.Welcome to my apartment.

That line of work has allowed me to meet interesting people and experiencing unique places so hosting Airbnb is kind of a natural fit for me.  I'm always happy to give local tips on where to go, what to avoid, and what to do--after all, that's one of the great things about renting through Airbnb.  Aside from that, I'm a chill, nice guy.  I have an office that I work out of most days during the week.   On the weekends, I'm usually out with friends or filming passion projects that I have on the side.  I also enjoy feeding farm animals carrots and vegetables and such (see photo).",0.639431672829,0.3151081188,0.565741744285,0.506760511971,b

Whether it is tips on making reservations, lesser-known tours and museums and or outdoor experiences like great parks or sports activities, it makes a difference to have some inside information on how to get there, when to go, if it is worth the price of admission. My style is to learn a little about you up front so I'm comfortable with you as a guest. This is so important to me and should also be important to my guests. You want to have the best experience, too! I like guests who are verified in every way that is possible for them and also who have positive reviews. But, I understand that many people are just trying Airbnb for the first time and I try to factor that in to my decisions. Just let me know if you have any questions.

I invite energies of healing, compassion, tenderness and care to my home. My interests are in the areas of holistic living, nonviolence, contemplative practices, listening arts, unschooling, unjobbing, free-range living, family preservation, conflict-to-creativity processes, holistic healing, gift economy, subtle energies, home birth, partnership parenting, conscious living, conscious dying, service, and more.  My passion is defending children in the judicial system.  Together, we can imagine and reinvent a judicial system that honors the humanity and autonomy of children. Some of my practices are in the realms of NVC- nonviolent communication, transforming energy images, translating judgments to feelings/needs, (if you're into NVC I'm open to practicing with you) Focusing (Eugene Gendlin) (if you're into focusing, I'm open to focusing with you), breath meditation (breath is the bridge to the subtle realms), somatic awareness, and more. Favorite mottos: ''Live and let live'' and ''If you love a flower, let it be'', ''If you love a being, don't cage it''.  Except mosquitos. I have no mercy when it comes to mosquitos. Swat. Dead.

25684584,"“The first thing you notice about New Orleans are the burying grounds - the cemeteries - and they're a cold proposition, one of the best things there are here. Going by, you try to be as quiet as possible, better to let them sleep. Greek, Roman, sepulchres- palatial mausoleums made to order, phantomesque, signs and symbols of hidden decay - ghosts of women and men who have sinned and who've died and are now living in tombs. The past doesn't pass away so quickly here. You could be dead for a long time.The ghosts race towards the light, you can almost hear the heavy breathing spirits, all determined to get somewhere. New Orleans, unlike a lot of those places you go back to and that don't have the magic anymore, still has got it. Night can swallow you up, yet none of it touches you. Around any corner, there's a promise of something daring and ideal and things are just getting going. There's something obscenely joyful behind every door, either that or somebody crying with their head in their hands. A lazy rhythm looms in the dreamy air and the atmosphere pulsates with bygone duels, past-life romance, comrades requesting comrades to aid them in some way. You can't see it, but you know it's here. Somebody is always sinking. Everyone seems to be from some very old Southern families. Either that or a foreigner. I like the way it is.There are a lot of places I like, but I like New Orleans better. There's a thousand different angles at any moment. At any time you could run into a ritual honoring some vaguely known queen. Bluebloods, titled persons like crazy drunks, lean weakly against the walls and drag themselves through the gutter. Even they seem to have insights you might want to listen to. No action seems inappropriate here. The city is one very long poem. Gardens full of pansies, pink petunias, opiates. Flower-bedecked shrines, white myrtles, bougainvillea and purple oleander stimulate your senses, make you feel cool and clear inside.Everything in New Orleans is a good idea. Bijou temple-type cottages and lyric cathedrals side by side. Houses and mansions, structures of wild grace. Italianate, Gothic, Romanesque, Greek Revival standing in a long line in the rain. Roman Catholic art. Sweeping front porches, turrets, cast-iron balconies, colonnades- 30-foot columns, gloriously beautiful- double pitched roofs, all the architecture of the whole wide world and it doesn't move. All that and a town square where public executions took place. In New Orleans you could almost see other dimensions. There's only one day at a time here, then it's tonight and then tomorrow will be today again. Chronic melancholia hanging from the trees. You never get tired of it. After a while you start to feel like a ghost from one of the tombs, like you're in a wax museum below crimson clouds. Spirit empire. Wealthy empire. One of Napoleon's generals, Lallemaud, was said to have come here to check it out, looking for a place for his commander to seek refuge after Waterloo. He scouted around and left, said that here the devil is damned, just like everybody else, only worse. The devil comes here and sighs. New Orleans. Exquisite, old-fashioned. A great place to live vicariously. Nothing makes any difference and you never feel hurt, a great place to really hit on things. Somebody puts something in front of you here and you might as well drink it. Great place to be intimate or do nothing. A place to come and hope you'll get smart - to feed pigeons looking for handouts” bob dylan",-0.909833945494,-1.03163292598,-1.14337292437,-1.02827993195,b

One fateful night she fell off of table into the arms of an Englishman of royal descent - his father appeared in Monty Python's lumberjack (watch it, bottom right, the resemblance is uncanny). 3 short years and lots of expensive flights later they were married, in Vegas, by Elvis, in a pink Cadillac at a drive-through wedding. The reception was at Hooters where they did Jell-o shots with the aforementioned Elvis.The happiest day of both of their lives was when they found the feline godlike creature who became known as Lloydy. He has tolerated their embarrassing adoration ever since on condition they feed him fried chicken occasionally and build him a throne (which they rent their rooms out to pay for).After 9 years in foggy London town they moved to New Orleans where they mainly listen to blues, drink craft ale and (occasionally) work at Universities (Lloydy teaches philosophy).We like guests who are laid-back, happy and like food, talking about food, and food-related activities.

Amended 10/18/15.  After having hosted hundreds of people, the best advice I can give everyone is to save all your emails from airbnb, especially your confirmation email.  That has all your check in details, address, and contact information for your host.  If you have to ask your host how to check in, or what's the address, you're going to look like a person who doesn't take the time to read what they're agreeing to and worse potentially a bad airbnb experience.  Also, if this is your first time, I'm a great host to start with, but like I said read everything about the listing before and after your booking.  Cheers! Amended 12/3/15 If you have read this far, I want to take the time to say this network is not a giant hotel where we all work for the same company.  It's a network, an online database of people who are willing to allow other people into their private homes so tourism can grow and travelers can have more options to the rising hotel costs.  One benefit you get by staying with me, I'm on the property.  Be mindful, some of these Airbnb listings have great pictures and a friendly-looking host, but some of the listings in Los Angeles are created by building managers who open one of the apartments in the building to Airbnb instead of putting a tenant in the unit.  Be aware this is against housing codes, and if the city of Los Angeles finds out, the building could be forced to stop using Airbnb, which means your reservation is cancelled.  Airbnb is supposed to be for owners or house dwellers to open their extra space to people passing through.  I've successfully accomplished this here.  My property is not the Ritz 5-Star Luxury Hotel, but it is a 4.5 Star Budget dwelling that you see in the reviews.  I'm on-site to address any issues as documented in my reviews.  I'm just generally a nice person, so long as guests have read all their instructions ;), and I have a huge amount of information and resources that you simply won't get at a hotel.  I know how to travel the city, when to travel the city, where to travel in the city, I can tell you where to buy whatever you want, and I can show you how to use the internet to discover LA.  If I were my host, I would be super excited to think I'm coming to visit me, I would be gearing up many questions to ask me so I can have the funnest, most memorable trip to LA anyone has ever had.

Hello!  My family owns an elegant, historic but well-maintained brownstone in the idyllic Prospect Heights section of booming Brooklyn (1.5 blocks from trains, 4 blocks from the sports arena, 6 blocks from Prospect Park/Grand Army Plaza/Museum/Botanic Gardens and surrounded by fantastic restaurants and stores!), and we provide a few rooms at select times and for select guests.  I've benefited greatly from international travel, friendship and hospitality - and I seek to give back and provide this exposure to my daughter. Therefore, **if you don't have much in your profile or in reviews, please tell us a bit about yourself as it's important that we know a little something about you so that we aren't bringing complete strangers into our home.** Now, about the place and neighborhood generally:WE WELCOME: all who come with a positive attitude and respect for our home; and we affirm that nationality, race, religion and sexual orientation are no issue.  LOCATION: vibrant and convenient Prospect Heights/Park Slope area, full of some of Brooklyn's best restaurants and shops. We're a half block from 4 great breakfast spots, an excellent taco place, great Italian, etc. ... and 2 blocks from the famous Geido Japanese, Thai, etc etc!  Safe, beautiful, tree-lined block, 2 blocks from major intersection of 7th Avenue & Flatbush.THE HOUSE: Large duplex in beautiful, well-kept brownstone. Elegant large living rm & dining rm, adorned with African/Caribbean/Latin American art and instruments, including tuned piano).  Washer/dryer; Wifi internet.  (No cable t.v. & there are no pets in the house.) Small amenities: hair-dryer, iron. …and of course bed linen and towels.GUEST EXPECTATIONS: to be responsible, clean, respect normal house protocols and operate largely within their rooms or the deck and backyard.  (I work from home and am actively in the living and dining room, although viewing of the art and books and occasional piano playing is completely welcomed!) Noise should be kept reasonably low (& pls be sure to have a microphone head-set for internet calls to avoid loud talk).  No pets allowed.  Sorry but no entertaining guests.  MORE ABOUT MYSELF: I'm an active dad of a friendly 11 year-old daughter (who's with me much of the time but also with her mom some nights);  a social justice advocate working independently with nonprofits & foundations; a lover of the arts and amateur musician; and have traveled extensively (with Africa as a special focus).  I love meeting new people and introducing them to my great neighborhood; but, I am also busy and so will be pleasant but not readily available for much hanging out.  My daughter also likes people, enjoys learning about different places and cultures, and loves music, dancing and reading.  (You can also learn more about us from the many reviews that are posted.)  NYC TIPS: I happily share with guests information about cultural happenings, neighborhood restaurants, and sight-seeing tips aimed at capturing the full cultural diversity and historical richness of New York City! APARTMENT SET-UP:  These rooms are in a large duplex apartment within a classic Brooklyn ""brownstone"" 4-level house.  The apartment (""apt"") begins on the ""parlor"" floor (meaning outside you come up 1 flight), which has the living rm, kitchen & dining rm (which doubles as Room #3).  The 2nd level has Rooms #1 (""LARGE room""),  #2 (""garden window"") & 4 (the Master BD, which is my room & therefore rarely rented) - plus both the full BA (for all) & the 1/2 BA (located within Rm #4). There is no elevator or chair-lift. (The street level is a separate garden apt.)
Late arrivals are NOT a problem.
*KITCHEN ACCESS: kitchen access is limited & varies a bit by the room, so pls be sure to see the details described within the room listings.  .... and a few notes: IF WE PROCEED WITH BOOKING:a) be sure to closely review the ""House Manual"" (in the Airbnb confirmation, under ""View reservation details"") and ALSO the ""Arrival Info"" email I will send you (to avoid mishaps and any charges for breakage or special cleaning**).  You should PRINT both of these items to bring with you since they include  airport travel tips,  details on accessing the house, key instructions, Wi-fi code, etc.; and ...b) Please send me your arrival time EARLY (& at least 48 hours in advance) so I can plan. 
 ======This particular review was so nice that I'm posting the English translation here (exactly from (website hidden) translator): ""This was our first experience with AIRBNB and we were not disappointed. We were delighted to make the acquaintance of Mitty has made ​​every effort to make our stay more enjoyable. We immediately felt at home. Our room was really spacious and comfortable. Direct access to the floor from the staircase allows independence we appreciated. Very well located in a quiet, leafy street in a very nice neighborhood in Brooklyn, a city within the city that we have enjoyed discovering and also very close to the subway leading to Manhattan. This really is the ideal location. And Mitty is the ""picture of New York"" helpful and welcoming. Mitty Thanks for letting us share your love for Brooklyn and we welcome that you have booked."" - Chantal and Jean-Pierre (October '13)",0.248494480736,0.819166806204,0.760936399545,0.609532562162,b

This last year my work gave me the opportunity to work on a project in Amsterdam and I decided to rent my home on airbnb while I'm away enjoying my new European lifestyle! Since I used to normally live in the home full time, there is everything you can possibly need from pots/pans to spices, towels, linens, etc.   I am looking for renters that can care about my home as much as I do, which means to treat it with respect.  If you are in Chicago, it's probably for a vacation and I expect you to have fun, just please do it responsibly.    If you are interested in renting my home please remember it is a 3 night minimum.  I will not rent to those who have not filled out alll of their verifications so please remember to do so.   I'm sure you will love my home as much as I do.  Please feel free to reach out ot me with any questions you may have about the property.Thanks!",0.548604183068,-0.207676943967,0.396810027633,0.245912422245,b

That's pretty cool. If you ask nicely we will probably loan you our bikes so you can ride too. Interesting facts: We have seen the Disney movie ""Frozen"" at least 11 times. You'd probably love it too, but we won't make you watch it.We have a dog named ""Gobi"" who is half Labrador Retriever and half Great Dane.

I am a proud, California native and have been living in my funky SF flat for over a decade now. I am a lover of arts & culture, in particular, Caribbean music, dance and cuisine. Born and raised on the beautiful island of Puerto Rico, Hector is a gifted musician, teacher and chef. With his original, traditional and popular sound, he leads his own band called La Mixta Criolla, which you can find on itunes. We love meeting and hosting people from all over the world. Since 2010, we have hosted more than 200 guests from more than 20 different countries. We truly appreciate the wonderful opportunity to meet like-minded folks and create amazing connections from all over the globe! In addition to being a superhost, last year I was featured in Airbnb's 'Why Host' Campaign on Airbnb tv, and was recently interviewed on the local news for being one of the city's most active hosts. Ideally, we want to show our guests a great time, break bread, share wonderful conversations to learn about you and where you come from! I take great pride in my home and make every attempt to keep it updated, beautiful and aesthetically pleasing for everyone. From Europe to Asia, South America to Canada, come over and experience ""The Urban Oasis SF"" for yourselves! We have a warm, friendly, multicultural vibe and environmentally-conscious home awaiting you! So don't wait to book, it's especially popular during high season (March-November).

This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music. DC - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.",0.785051926149,0.984155991592,0.334513242367,0.701240386703,b

7091107,"Hello Dear Wanderers, Travelers and Families on a Beautiful Journey!  It is truly my pleasure to make your acquaintance in advance....  ;-)I have been a hostess for a long while by now and I am loving every single moment of it.  When I got my “Superhost”  badge I danced around the living room in the silliest way you can ever imagine.  Well,  admittedly it wasn't the most dignified response but pretty much reflected my immediate need to celebrate!   I genuinely care about my guests and I want to make sure that each and every one has the best possible experience staying at my place and their visit is seamless, happy and memorable. Being a “Superhost”  is like having superhero powers… -  it is important to easily deflect unexpected problems, just like ducking from the punches of your arch nemesis;  it helps if you see into the future by anticipating seemingly impossible issues and it is a bonus if you are crazy-caring and just generally want to save the world on a daily bases. I have traveled the world all my life for work and fun and I know how important it is to feel comfortable, safe and relaxed when you arrive to a new destination and you just want to take a long shower and cozy up in the perfect bed. I can completely relate....Nowadays I cannot imagine a better feeling than be on the other side of traveling: be a hostess to happily content travelers and also through my other work, empowering people to take charge of their own health and wellbeing. I love this city with its vortex of amazing, caring, enlightened and fun individuals, its endless sunshine, its multi-faceted offerings. I am so truly blessed to be based here, I would love to host you and hope your visit to L.A. will make you as happy as this city has made me by living here. It was a great pleasure creating these two homes with deep care and detailed attention. In the process I have even fallen in love with them and it is so hard not to just move in and live there myself!  lol It is my deepest wish that you will love it as much as I do…..See you and talk to you soon!Anita",1.35394662347,2.61701925581,1.66971478155,1.88022688694,b

I don't think I'll ever get bored of this city! I love trying as many new restaurants as I can whenever I'm free or taking friends out. Especially friends that visit from all over the world.

Reading is another thing that I haven't really got a chance to do these days due to balancing work and everyday activities. I have so many books just waiting for me to read. I don't have a particular favorite author but I do love Life of Pi by Yann Martel, Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan, Zadie Smith books, David Sedaris writing style is beautiful and so many more known and unknown authors that I'm open to reading. I love watching TV too whenever I get a chance and try to catch any rom coms or stuff like Shameless, Game of Thrones, Anthony Bourdain, travel shows and more.

Remember you have chosen to stay at ______ house, and if there is something you don’t like about it, you had the choice not to stay there. Likewise, hosts should have included all the details that you should know about their listing. • Coordinate a time that you would like to check-in at.HAVE A COMPLETE PROFILE • Having reviews matter but if you are a Airbnb newbie I recommend writing something about yourself on your profile. A brief summary who you are, what you like, what are your passions, hobbies etc..  • Include a recent, clear photo of your face (no pets/ children/ abstract paintings). Hosts want to verify a profile to the person to confirm whom is staying with them. VERIFY YOUR ID• It only takes a few minutes and it shows you value trust in our community. Also a verified email address and phone number. Doing these small things will increase the odds of an approved booking by tenfold. This is true for inquiries you make of any Host, not only me.See: https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 Thank you for providing all the necessary details.

I could say the same about how the show Father Ted made folks really know Ireland- the good, the bad, and the ridiculous. Well, it is our turn now, and what a great time to live here. There is a Food Renaissance here that is complemented by Art, Tech, Learning, Nature, Sustainability, and some of the friendliest people anywhere.I am a bit of a stereotype of Portland since I have a business in green rentals as well as being an extremely social, nerdy, outdoors loving, book reading person. And I adore living in Portland and knowing at least a little bit about everything that is going on. What do you want to do?I have a bunch of Irish influence which makes me a social story-teller who loves guests.  I enjoy hosting folks as well as traveling. I have spent time living in Argentina, Mexico, France, and Hawaii. I live in Ireland as well as in the States.Sharing my home and other properties is my calling. I designed the Taylor house be lovely, healthy, green, and efficient- it's the Sustainable Economist in me. The other properties that I list I have remodeled to be fun and healthy as well. The house in Ireland is on my ancestor's land and I grew up going to this house. I have spent the last two years doing a major remodel and it looks great. La Casita was where I taught Argentine Tango for many years and is quite charming. I also have a house that I rent full time that was featured on the GreenRenter site and is an offical G-Rated environmental home.A key thing about what I offer as a host is what I am looking for as a guest. I can't stand chain hotels. They can be quite luxurious but they always come across as impersonal. Give me a fun walkable neighborhood that real people live, work and play- and That is where I wish to stay. My properties are unique luxurious spaces that I created for myself, my family and my community that I can also share with you. One last thing, these are my personal properties so there are no surprises about folks who are subletting through Airbnb. I have a great team (Talia and Anastasia ) who take care of things when I am away, but you can always contact me directly through email with any concerns or questions.I am a social person so hosting comes naturally to me and I have often had folks staying with me even before AirBnB. Friends stay with me or just toss relations and friends my way to take in. Now thanks to the Share-economy so many things are possible that are community building, sustainable, and amazing.There are many changes happening with short term rentals and the City of Portland.

We first began building together in 2012 when we built the Rustic Modern Tiny House in Portland, Oregon. While building we realized that we loved working together and that designing and building artfully inclined spaces meant a lot to us.  After taking a couple years off from building together we really found ourselves missing it. Joshua Tree was our first weekend away together and we always loved it here so we said ""Let's move to the desert and out of LA and make something together!""  Our most recent art project was rebuilding a 1950s homesteader cabin. Just a little under 500SF but surrounded by huge open skies.  We never dreamed of having this much space. What we love most about the Home Sweet Homesteader is the view from the patio.

My foundation work takes me to the Middle East and Asia a bit which is equally amazing.A fun fact - I'm about to crash a destination wedding...but announced it beforehand and already send a present.  Does that still qualify as crashing?On the tech front, I'm a bit fickle lately.  Just switched phones, for the third time this year, to the big boy iphone after deciding to take a break from Android.  I work exclusively from a Macbook running both Windows and the Mac OS.  I have to thank my Kindle for tricking me into reading again - so light and portable - and TMobile has been a true champ for rolling out free international data & text which comes in very handy during my trips.Do I have a life motto?  Not really but ""Strike while the iron is hot"" is a good way to run things.

2013410,"Hello!  A few years back, I founded a small company called Peak Design that makes accessories for the photographic and outdoor industries.  We're based in San Francisco, so I split my time between there and Chicago so that I can spend half my month with my incredible 3 year old daughter Josephine.  Her mom lives a few blocks away, so finding a comfortable place to call home in the neighborhood was a top priority.  Airbnb has given me the opportunity to make this an affordable situation, and I'm grateful for it and the other marvels of the modern world that allow me to live in SF half the time and still have a full time relationship with my daughter.I've built the majority of the furniture in my home.  In fact, the kitchen table, nightstands, writing desk, both beds, and the art project on the wall were all created in my basement workshop...all from wood that I found on the premises when I moved in!  I'm not sure if that's because of my midwestern frugality (I grew up in Minneapolis) or the fact that one can only handle so many lumberyard trips.I try to take great care of my place, and I hope to find guests who appreciate its cleanliness and simplicity.  I only have basic cable, but the Apple TV is yours to use, as is the Bluetooth stereo I keep in the kitchen.The fact that I generally rent my unit when I'm in San Francisco means it's rare that we'll meet in person.  Regardless, airbnb provides a great way of connecting people, and I look forward to the folks I'll get become acquainted with.The neighbors are all well aware of my airbnb situation, and are extraordinarily friendly.  Leah, my neighbor, will be helping out with some on site tasks when I'm not around.  Say hello for me if you see her.Thanks!Peter",1.25611395491,0.821616488165,0.966662116384,1.01479751982,b

My mother owned it before me, and my grandmother lovingly chose it before her in 1961 when the Valley was just a bedroom community for Hollywood professionals.  I plan to live here for the rest of my years since I'm 50-ish and deeply rooted in the entertainment industry, but I love that this place feels like ""the burbs"" in so many ways... easy parking being a very nice example. Our favorite place to walk to for dinner is Il Tiramisu for Northern Italian cuisine, just a two minute walk away. There are literally a dozen top-rated places within an very short walk.I'm an adopted Packer and Badger fan (hence the costly NFL package on the Direct TV service), but all fans and non-fans are welcome here, of course. Our highly effective alarm dog seems to know the difference between contracted guests and solicitors, and he sits in his front window seat of the main house like Cerberus guarding against the unwelcome. As our guest, you will be greeted with a wagging tail, or not at all if you prefer. We keep an eye out for our guests while respecting their privacy. No one gets through the gate without our knowing they belong behind that gate, and at the same time we consider the back garden and hammock to be your home away from home during your stay. We enjoy meeting people from all over the world and enjoy the opportunity to continue to work on our language skills. We don't seek to provide the cheapest place to stay, but rather the best value possible. This space is essentially my ""Barbie Dream Vacation Rental"" without the pink or the plastic. Please don't make a reservation if you want to apply your purple glitter nail polish on the nice linens. DO grace us with your presence if you appreciate a beautiful, safe place where the owners are willing to invest untold hours dollars into making the place hopefully nicer than anything else you can find for your hard-earned dollars. We believe that business must always be a win-win, exchanging value for value with both parties believing they are getting something well worth the expenditure. We seem to attract as repeat guests either grown-up entertainment industry professionals or grown-ups who are visiting family in the area. If you're an expectant grandparent with unclear dates as a result of Mother Nature's capricious ways, please let us know as we may be able to accommodate your need for flexibility with your reservation.

324630,"I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",0.829073045738,1.2951476188,1.15404353247,1.09275473234,b

She attends a high school on a college campus, combining high school classes and college classes.  Her favorite food is anything vegetarian, though last year we convinced her to start eating fish, so she also enjoys sushi.  Our favorite family vacation experiences range from snorkeling and hiking in Hawaii to white water river rafting in Idaho.   As a family, we also enjoy playing games.  Our favorites are games where no one really wins like Apples to Apples, Snake Oil and Cards Against Humanity (a guilty, but funny pleasure)",0.665284053115,0.147325425876,0.750432263966,0.521013914319,b

19656770,"Hi.  I am proud a father of a lovely 6 year old daughter.  I am an ARMY veteran and I like almost every form of dancing (swing/salsa/balroom,etc..)  My daughter stays with her mom and I see her 4-5 times a week.   I black out the nights my daughter is with me on the calendar.  Don't worry.I am new at hosting guests on airbnb but I am very serious about it.  I invested $1,000.00 in new bedding (sheets/comfortors/pillows), bath (towels, mats, etc) so my place is as amazing as it can be for my guests.Professionally, I am a computer programmer growing into being an international businessman.  I run a small consulting firm with talented computer programmers in Peru.  I am really, really excited it is 2014 and web sites like airbnb exist so a ""regular joe"" like me can start a micro-buisness such as renting my home, my car (get around, relayrides), or providing services such as driving my car (uber, lyft).I am hosting guests on airbnb to save money for travelling myself.  I'm planning a business trip to Phoenix, and I don't like to stay for less than two weeks when I travel.  I'll most certainly be staying with an airbnb host.In fact, I can work from anywhere, as I just need my laptop, so I'm planning to visit many many cities in the U.S. via airbnb soon.The last country I traveled to was Peru.  I've been there three times, to Lima, to my daughter's grandparents who are Peruvian.  I hope to go to Peru again soon.I'm actually pretty serious about that, I even joined the US Army with a guaranteed contract to go to Korea!   I was able to stay in Korea for a whole year.   It was absolutely worth it.When I'm not working, I like to swing or salsa dance, even ballroom dance once in a while.  I'm all about dancing with a partner.  I also like expensive whiskey, tequila, gin oh and beer too.  But, don't worry.  I drink primarily for the taste now, as I have a 6 year old daughter and she may need me to be coherent in a moments notice, so I take it slow.I used to work as a line cook in a truck stop, so it really is second nature for me to throw some eggs and bacon on the grill, and I'm pretty good making pancakes too. When you stay at my place, you'll be in the master suite.  You have private access to the bathroom in there.   I'll be in my daughter's room.  Again, I don't rent the room out when she is staying overnight.. She stays at her mom's, and if the room books for a weekend when I have her overnight, we're going to an indoor water park, thanks so much for helping me to give my daughter a wonderful childhood!!Thanks!",-1.0557598804,-1.0168416413,-1.02235533852,-1.03165228674,b

I've had several businesses; most lasting for more than 45 years. I know a lot about DC history and love telling interesting stories of yesteryear! I am very friendly but have a great knack at serious business.  It all began in 1969 when me and Hilton Felton, my music director, started our youth singing group named ""Ed Gerald Gospel Sounds"". Consequently, for more than 23 years I produced a local (Metropolitan DC) Gospel Show called, ""Spread a Little Sunshine"", on TV - WTOP, WUSA--CBS Channel 9. Simultaneously, I recorded and produced gospel music; started Paradise Productions Studio next door to this building, then obtained the current building in 1995. This current building produced records under the labels ""Paradise Productions"", ""Energy for God Record Company"", Gospel World of E.G., then ""EG Record Company."" Many notable gospel artists were produced in this building, including the Dorsey Team of Dr. Clayton Hannah and Dr. Thomas A Dorsey. People who have stayed at my property have had a pleasant fun stay and usually don't like leaving on-time which is ok with me too!  Each of my rented rooms are arranged for your privacy as much as possible (even the few rooms with some shared spaces). These rooms will have some significant historical meaning of my times in DC during the years of TV or Radio producing or recording music or shows that were also performed and presented in metropolitan Parks and Recreation.If you ask not you receive not, is my favorite motto!  Be encouraged...life is truly too short.Before booking: Link your Airbnb profile to a social network, verify your phone number; and  complete your Airbnb profile. If your profile is not complete, upon checkin, expect us to ask to view a photo ID and possibly make a copy for our private records. The purpose is for emergencies and security, like hotels would expect.After booking: Make sure you send a note letting us know when we will expect your arrival. You may give us your travel itinerary, for instance.  It will be helpful in arranging your checkin, if you plan to arrive within our usual 4pm checkin timeframe. If you expect to arrive more than 1 hour later than the estimated time you gave us, call or send a text updating your arrival time. If we have waited longer than an hour and don't hear from you, you may get charged $20 cash when you check in, for arranging to return or getting someone else to let you in.When you get the opportunity to stay as our guest(s), make sure you read the online House Manual for clarity in your stay and especially your checkout procedures. The Manual is located near the description of the room you selected and booked. Please read details so that you don't get locked out, for instance. With some locations of the rooms there might be noises that you are not familiar with. This building is located on a busy travel street also. If you are sensitive to noise, we suggest you bring ear plugs.Remember that Airbnb is not for guests expecting perfection, but for travelers who appreciate getting to know a host and our surroundings, and bonding with the neighborhood and who appreciate saving money. There are many hotel locations in DC but are two to three times or more the price per night.We expect you to keep your room(s) and immediate area tidy as possible during your stay. This will help you to follow checkout procedures, avoid additional cleanup fee charges, and when you leave, possibly avoid leaving anything behind.  You may text or call us anytime before, during, or as you check out with any questions about your visit. Thank You and Welcome to Our Nations Capital, DC!                                        #############################I can schedule for a basic driving tour of NW DC including Smithsonian, NatL Archives, Air & Space Museum; Iwa Jima Memorial, US Capital, Supreme Court, White House, Washington Monument, and a few more popular sites around NW Washington. I charge $45/hour for your group, up to 4 people. By the hour charges only apply (no halfs calculated). This Is daytime 9-6. After 6pm til midnight, $55/hour basic evening/night tour.   Ask about my airport transportation service as well. I operate in all the metropolitan airports.  If you're interested in the above,  let me know in advance what you prefer for scheduling.If you are driving and want to know what to do about parking in our neighborhood, there are some options.  There is free street parking. However, its imperative you follow street signs for areas that require you to move your car during street cleaning times. You must watch the dates and times when its restricted. Also, watch ""Residential Zone"" parking. Hefty fines are issued if there are violations and/or you may be subjected to towing. Make sure you do not fail to adhere to DC's parking restrictions!If you expect to stay and park in our neighborhood for longer than two weeks with another State license plate, you need to go to DMV to get a temporary parking permit. (The District's Parking Enforcers will keep track).  There are also downtown parking lots and garages. You can find them on a ""Parking Panda"" App. If you don't want to be concerned about the parking, i also rent a parking space behind the home and I would need to schedule you, if its available during your stay.

344035,"August 21, 2015I'm Len. I'm an amateur cook and vegetable gardener, an entrepreneur, and a traveler, by bicycle whenever possible. I live in the first floor apartment of my beautiful four story brownstone in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.  My cousin Tania  (https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/9772800) lives on the 2nd floor, and  we're both new hosts on AirBnB.I try to assist all kinds of travelers by offering more than just some space and a bed. Explorers on a budget, families, young professionals, and experienced  business travelers have different needs, and Prospect Heights can be a great neighborhood for all of you.For now, my listing(s) will be for travelers booking short stays in the next 60 days.Tania's are aimed at visitors coming for longer stays or planning further ahead (no instant booking, but we respond quickly).Let us know how we can help with your visit to Brooklyn and to New York City. AirBnB suggests sharing a ""five favorites"" list.  Why not?  I've traveled to dozens of destinations all over the United States and Canada, and around the world for work and for holidays.Some of my all-time favorite trips, in no special order:-Three weeks on the South Island of New Zealand.  My first time celebrating New-Years-Eve in Summer.  Made new friends and saw a landscape that is even more amazing in person than in the Lord of the Rings movies, no special effects required.-My first visit to Vietnam in 2006 for a weeklong wedding celebration then  a not-for-tourists tour led by locals: the newlyweds! (Yes, my friends still got a great honeymoon, after a week of hosting 10 guests, not just for a home, but for a country).-Nine weeks bicycling in France. French food is probably my favorite, and with ""cyclotourism"" holidays there is almost no limit to how much I can enjoy without putting on pounds.-My first ever cycling tour, from Los Angeles to San Francisco, with two old friends from high school not long after University.  The scenery, meeting other cyclists while camping, and the feeling of accomplishment each day made me a convert to vacations spent pedaling.-On a business trip to Manilla in early November 2000,  I got to watch a peaceful political revolution across the street from my room!  At the same time, I was following the news:  voters back home in the US were learning that it can take more than just an election to decide who gets to be president.If you read this far...well, thanks again! I hope to hear from you.",0.152226745861,0.275684511095,0.769515572028,0.399142276328,b

Bobby loves his sports, his beer, and originally hails from the great nation of Texas.  We have been hosts for more than 1 year, and we have connected with people from over 35 different cities!!

We generally cook at home in the evening, so love to share some wine or beer with our guests!Our schedules are quite busy, Bobby just started working for American Express in downtown manhattan, and Alondra works for Tommy Hilfiger in Chelsea, on the west side of Manhattan.  We both are out during days, but are reachable always and return in the evenings.Our apartment is beautiful.  The moment we walked in 3 years ago, we both knew it would be our home for sometime to come.  Railroad style, there are 2 big bedrooms, with big, open windows.  The kitchen, bathroom, and living room all have brand new appliances, with high ceilings and recessed lighting.  The brick makes it feel more homely.  The apartment is safe, and the building is quiet.Bushwick is an awesome place to live.

21776430,"I grew up about 90 miles from New Orleans and after living in several cities around the U.S. I settled here in 2000 and continue to fall in love with the city ... My favorite area is called Frenchman Street because there is the heart of the live music scene with approximately 12 music clubs within a 3 block stretch  offering live music 7 nights a week ... From Frenchman it's a short walk west into the French Quarter or you can walk East and a little North to our newest developing area on St. Claude Ave, home to 5 or 6 clubs each with a unique character ... Since 2010 I hosted over 250 guests at my home in the French Quarter, first, and then my home in the Marigny Neighborhood via the website couch (website hidden) ... I met many wonderful people and had great times as host and guide ... The three areas I mentioned above are what my guests enjoyed the most ... So I'm new to airbnb but shouldn't be for long with Voodoo Festival coming up and then Mardi Gras, and not long after that Jazz Fest ... Happy travels to you and I hope to see you in New Orleans ...Six things I like to do: Philosophy Cafe in New Orleans, Swing dance camp in July in Sweden, Garden Festival in Croatia, Live music on Frenchman Street,  Work - I love to make my properties nice places to live, and Meditation - my quiet still time with myself.As a host I'm usually pretty busy with something but New Orleans is a small city and I'm not far away to help my guests any way I can.As a guest I will barely be seen as I will probably have much to do with not much time to do it ... and clean, orderly, and respectful.When I travel I have been preferring hostels and friends but now I will be discovering airbnb as well.Motto - Enjoy! and if you can, do some good.",0.626782978813,0.605239200827,0.659582230575,0.630534803405,b

So welcome, let us get acquainted; we were both islanders but from far away places.Fe was born on one of the two thousand inhabited islands in the Philippines (but did not visit them all) and came here to make the most out of life. She is a nurse and works for an international company that tests new products for pharmaceutical manufacturers. She fled a hot sun and oppressive humidity for a kinder sunny climate, but never from her genuine love of people which we both share. She still loves the water and fresh seafood, but above all life, music, and happy laughter. No wonder she turned into such a wonderful cook par excellence.  John was born in Denmark, developed a taste for traveling early and getting away from a dreary overcast climate. He came to the USA for college and never stopped seeking new horizons. In the process he discovered that language is not just a study course, but something to practice free lance while you meet this big wonderful world of ours, which grew immensely after he parked his childhood shoes. He lived in South America, did international business and visited half of the so called countries, for you must get out if you want to meet the world and develop appreciation. In time he also followed his dream and founded a company in the medical business.Nothing here is run of the mill.

I do my best to describe the space, location, amenities, bed, and other factors as accurately as possible. It is extremely important for you to have read my listing and observe any rules listed before booking.My house in Los Angeles (not the Ontario Location) is located 15 min from Santa Monica, 15 min from Hollywood, 10 min from Downtown LA, 10 min from West Hollywood.

In my profession I am always chatting with folks. I talk trash and straight talk interchangeably. Its fun to talk. That said, I have established relationships with many folks around the city and can get the hook up sometimes. I moved here to go to grad school. It took a dip in barton springs and one drunken night on the town seeing bands before I became hooked. Its a fun city let there be no doubt.I went to graduate school to study to become a librarian...lol!! I somehow got sidetracked. Just in case you wondered.  In my spare time, I tend to go to coffeeshops, read, write, go to peoples homes to hang out, a bar to watch a game, a back yard party, play basketball, work out and so forth. I love to watch movies. I go see bands often. I have always enjoyed staying at bed and breakfasts when I have traveled in times past more than a hotel. I remember the time that I stayed at couple's house in Amsterdam.

But based on my previous listings I promise you won't be disappointed.A little bit about me. I just recently moved to the city to move in with my husband. I closed my daycare, sold my home and moved away from my family. So, now am teaching preschool and maintaining my family and home here. I use to live in the suburbs so it was hard adjusting but I'll have to admit l love it. It's close to everything and I feel comfortable and safe. However, since I come from a family of 5 and am very close to my brothers and sisters it was hard being so far away. But with my husband and dog they made it a lot easier for me. So I will try and make you feel at home as much as possible because I know the feeling of being away whether it's for vacation, business or just cause it's always nice to be comfortable where your at. But other than that I am an outgoing, responsible person. If you have a problem or don't like something feel free to let us know. We are always trying to improve our place.

I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on.
